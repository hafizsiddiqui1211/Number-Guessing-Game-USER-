# Guess The Number Game 🎯

This is a simple **number guessing game** where the player has to guess a random number between **0 and 100** within **7 attempts**.

## 🛠 How It Works
- The program randomly selects a number between **0 and 100**.
- The player has **7 chances** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program provides feedback:
  - **"Too low!"** if the guess is smaller than the actual number.
  - **"Too high!"** if the guess is greater than the actual number.
  - **"🎉 Congratulations!"** if the guess is correct.
- If the player **fails to guess the number in 7 attempts**, the correct number is revealed.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python** installed (version **3.x** recommended).
2. Save the script as `guess_the_number.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
